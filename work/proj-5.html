        Eat With Needs is a school project. I worked in a group of 4 students. The concept is a mobile friendly website that helps people with different kinds of allergies to find restaurants and bars that offers food within their needs.

  Throughout research and interviews we found that it is often a problem to find a place to eat without asking the waiter each place a bounch a questions. With this solution it is not neccessary to ask questions and thereby avoid waste of time and uncomfortable questions. The difficulties in this concept is to gain value to the restaurants that can offset the time they have to use in specifying the meals they offer. We spent time talking with some restaurants where most of them liked the idea. The project was completed with good grades and praise from teachers.
